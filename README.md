# 🌊 Data Beneath the Waves: Indian Ocean Warming Patterns (2014–2024)

## 📌 Overview

This Power BI dashboard explores **simulated Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data** across the **Indian Ocean** region from 2014 to 2024. It visualizes warming trends, seasonal shifts, and potential climate signals through intuitive, interactive visual storytelling.

Created as a **self-driven project**, this dashboard is part of a personal exploration series into environmental and climate data analytics.

## 🔍 Why this project was built?

This project was built independently to:
- Apply storytelling with real-world inspired climate data
- Explore oceanic warming beyond textbook examples
- Learn dashboarding by interpreting **temporal + spatial patterns**
- Fill the gap where ready-to-use Indian Ocean SST datasets were **not publicly downloadable** but patterns were viewable

While no exact SST datasets were freely downloadable, the data was simulated based on trend patterns visible on public platforms like **NOAA Coral Reef Watch**, **NASA Earth Observations**, and **Copernicus Marine Services**. The structure was carefully modeled on real SST behavior over seasons and years.
